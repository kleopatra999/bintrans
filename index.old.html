<p><tt>bintrans</tt> is a dynamic binary translator.

<p><tt>bintrans</tt> is Free Software released under the <a href="COPYING">GNU GPL</a>.

<p>You can download <tt>bintrans</tt> <a href="bintrans-pre.tar.gz">here</a>.  Very crude installation
instruction can be found <a href="INSTALL">here</a>.  Please only download this if you are really
interested in <tt>bintrans</tt> and can't possibly wait until I have put together something which
is only mildly terribly hard to install (which should happen very, very soon).

<p>In any case, if you have any question, please don't hesitate <a href="mailto:schani@complang.tuwien.ac.at">mailing me</a>.
